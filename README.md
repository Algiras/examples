# Almond Examples

A collection of [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks showing what you can do with the [Almond](http://almond-sh.github.io/almond/stable/docs/intro) Scala kernel.

## See Notebook Output in nbviewer
You can view the notebooks directly on GitHub, as it has a basic renderer for Jupyter notebooks. It doesn't execute any JavaScript though, which severly limits its ability to show dynamically generated plots i.e. from plotly and vegas.

A much better option is to render them through [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). nbviewer supports loading notebooks directly from a repo on GitHub.

## Running locally
An even better way to learn about Jupyter and Almond is to run it locally so you can try things out for yourself.

To run these notebooks locally:
1. Install [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/install)
2. Install an [Almond kernel](http://almond-sh.github.io/almond/stable/docs/quick-start-install)
3. Clone the project and run `jupyter notebook` in the project directory
4. Open one of the example notebooks and play with it!
