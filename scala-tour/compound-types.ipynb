If it's `Cloneable` then the object can be `clone`d, but not `reset`; if it's `Resetable` we can `reset` it, but there is no `clone` operation. To avoid type casts in such a situation, we can specify the type of `obj` to be both `Cloneable` and `Resetable`. This compound type is written like this in Scala: `Cloneable with Resetable`.\n",
